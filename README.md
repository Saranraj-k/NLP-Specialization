## 📖 About

This repository is designed for learners and practitioners of NLP. It covers a broad range of topics including text preprocessing, tokenization, embeddings, language models, sequence modeling, and NLP application projects. The code and resources are suitable for students, researchers, and anyone interested in advancing their NLP skills.

## ✨ Features

- Core NLP algorithms and code samples
- Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning
- Preprocessing utilities for text data
- Implementation of classic and modern NLP models
- Example datasets and scripts for experiments
- Project templates for NLP applications

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Saranraj-k/NLP-Specialization.git
    cd NLP-Specialization
    ```
2. **Set up a Python environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv nlp-env
    source nlp-env/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🛠️ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install required packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some notebooks may require additional packages; installation instructions are provided within those notebooks.

## 📚 Usage

- Browse the [notebooks](notebooks/) directory for tutorials and experiments.
- Use scripts in [src/](src/) for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Datasets and sample files are in the [data/](data/) folder.

Example: Run a notebook using JupyterLab
```sh
jupyter lab
```
